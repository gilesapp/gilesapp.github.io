              <p class="lead mt-4"><b>Improve RL through reward shaping.</b></p>
              <p class="mt-2 mb-2">Using high-dimensional grids to abstract all the states generated in the training mode to reduce the total number of states. Once the trajectory is obtained, using statistical analysis to target defects state and apply reward shaping to fix them. Repeat this process until the model converges/reaches the optimal efficiency. The trained model is evaluated in different environments (competitive, single player) to verify the algorithm's efficiency.</p>
              <p class="mb-5">My current responsibilities: 1. To help the team members test the algorithm in the existing environment and organize the data. 2. To use the average reward value of the abstract state to test the efficiency of the algorithm based on the existing environment and algorithm (overlooking the effect of states traces).</p>

              <p class="lead mt-4"><b>Attention mechanism in graph embedding</b></p>
              <p class="mt-2 mb-2">Using QT (quasi-threshold) community generated by existing program which to group highly complex graph networks into tree diagram and to find the leader node to develop a new attention mechanism for graph embedding network model.</p>
              <p class="mt-2 mb-2">My responsibilities: 1. To learn and master the open-source graph network learning framework DGL and to use DGL to develop a deep learning attention mechinsm network. 2. Preprocessing the output results of the existing QT communiy program to be fed into the network as a source input graph. 3. Evaluating the model with other existing network models on different dataset in terms of loss rate and training time.</p>
              <p class="mb-5">Outcome: The graph embedding network model that introduces the attention mechanism using QT community can produce a comparable result to the existing attention mechinsm model in the training phase, and it can be trained faster in some data sets (for example protein-protein interaction data set).</p>

              <p class="lead mt-4"><b>Crowd counting optimization</b></p>
              <p class="mt-2 mb-2">Explore a way to improve the accuracy of the approximation of the crowd counting CNN without changing the existing structure of the network (such as the number of convolutional layers, the input and output dimensions of the layers, etc.). Specifically, through preprocessing, the pictures containing people (for example, the pictures of people in a venue taken by the camera of the Shanghai World Expo site) were pre-decomposed into equal-sized picture groups (e.g. a picture with a resolution of 1024*768 was divided into n 32* 32 small pictures), then sequentially fed into the network to get the number of people in each sub picture then comnbine them to find the total counting.</p>
              <p class="mt-2 mb-2">My responsibilities: 1. To implement the construction and utilization of CSRNet locally (mainly through reading CSRNet papers and related application method articles). 2. To develop the decomposition algorithm and program through pre-designed preprocessing schemes (decomposing the pictures in a non-overlapping manner; decomposing the pictures by overlapping in the horizontal or vertical direction; overlapping the decomposed pictures in the horizontal and vertical directions at the same time). 3. Evaluating proposed method results with existing method to demonstrate the effectiveness of the research.</p>
              <p class="mb-5">Outcome: 1. This method has exceptionally high accuracy when crowds in pictures are arranged in certain density, but this method is not generalized for all situations. 2. We find that the crowd arrangement of the picture's input to the neural network has a potential relationship with the accuracy that different algorithms or network structures can produce.</p>

              <p class="mt-2 mb-2">Translation and research of neural network-related papers (intelligent decision-making, alpha star "StarCraft 2" reproduction) to reproduce the Starcraft2 minigames agents.</p>
              <p class="mt-2 mb-2">Studied the A3C learning algorithm proposed by the alpha star team, in-depth its training ideas and how to solve the problem of dealing with a large number of parameters when calculating the loss function.</p>
              <p class="mb-5">Produced the code and used the existing network model on Github to learn the operation of a3c_agent and scripted_agent on the local computer.</p>
