              <p class="lead mt-4"><b>Understanding reinforcement learning neural network</b></p>
              <p class="mt-2 mb-2">Using high-dimensional grids to abstract all the states generated in the training model, so that the approximate state could be abstracted into one state to reduce the total number of states. After that, the game's chronologically arranged and completed state is divided into a trajectory, and each state is counted to encourage the model to adopt a winning state and repeat this process until the model reaches the optimal efficiency. The trained model will be tested in different environments (competitive, single player) to verify the algorithm's efficiency.</p>
              <p class="mb-2">My current responsibilities: 1. To help the team members test the algorithm in the existing environment and organize the data. 2. To use the average reward value of the abstract state to test the efficiency of the algorithm based on the existing environment and algorithm (do not pass the trajectory).</p>

              <p class="lead mt-4"><b>Attention mechanism in graph embedding</b></p>
              <p class="mt-2 mb-2">Used existed results of the program (based on the quasi-threshold community) to group highly complex graph networks and to find the leader node, then developed a set of graphs suitable for introducing the deep learning attention mechanism with the results as input Embedded network model.</p>
              <p class="mb-2">My responsibilities: 1. To learn and master the open-source graph network learning framework DGL and to use DGL to write a set of deep learning graph embedding networks suitable for existing graph classification programs. 2. Preprocessed the output results of the existing program to be embedded into the network as a data source input graph. 3. After establishing a deep learning graph embedding network equipped with attention mechanism, through experiments (different comparison tests of the same data and comparison tests with other existing network models), used DGL to develop and perfect a set of practical attention mechanisms deep learning graph embedding network.</p>

              <p class="lead mt-4"><b>Crowd counting optimization</b></p>
              <p class="mt-2 mb-2">Explored a way to improve the accuracy of the output without changing the existing structure of the crowd calculation convolutional neural network (such as the number of convolutional layers, the input and output dimensions of the layers, etc.). Specifically, through preprocessing, the pictures containing people (for example, the pictures of people in a venue taken by the camera of the Shanghai World Expo site) were pre-decomposed into equal-sized picture groups (e.g. a picture with a resolution of 1024*768 was divided into n 32* 32 small pictures), then sequentially inputted into picture group network to get the number of people in each picture, and calculated to get the final total people.</p>
              <p class="mb-2">My responsibilities: 1. To implement the construction and utilization of CSRNet locally (the realization process was mainly through reading CSRNet papers and related application method articles). 2. To realize the decomposition process through pre-designed preprocessing schemes (decomposing the pictures in a non-overlapping manner; decomposing the pictures by overlapping in the horizontal or vertical direction; overlapping the decomposed pictures in the horizontal and vertical directions at the same time) and coding, and to design a control experiment to compare with the method of inputting a complete picture. 3. To analyze the collected data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the research.</p>
